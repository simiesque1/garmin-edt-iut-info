built that in Monkey C (a weird language), used [@Vexcited](https://github.com/Vexcited)'s API for the institute's timetable so that i can look at my garmin watch and see in which room i'm in :)

big thanks to vexcited honestly

## example on my watch

## usage 

(edit the .xml if ur watch isn't the forerunner 55)

Download the .prg file from releases

Put it into ../GARMIN/APPS

That's it, just choose the app from your watch and it's working
